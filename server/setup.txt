	----------- Configure server -----------
	----------------------------------------

In order for the server to be able to accept incomming external
calls the GateWay router has to be configured for portforwarding. 

When setting up rules for portforwarding its important to set the
internal/local port to start at the value specified in the 
configfile (serverconfig.yaml).

Also make sure that the local IP address is that of the servers.
